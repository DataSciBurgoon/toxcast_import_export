#Purpose
The purpose of this project is to make our workflow for importing/exporting ToxCast Level 5 results reproducible. Specifically, I demonstrate:

1. How I imported the ToxCast v1 database into MySQL
2. How I exported the ToxCast Level 5 analysis results from MySQL
3. How I imported the ToxCast Level 5 analysis results into MongoDB
4. How I exported the ToxCast Level 5 analysis results from MongoDB into a JSON file

#Why?
I did this in order to facilitate downstream analyses, as part of the AOPXplorer program. Specifically, we are building a platform to facilitate data analysis, and data management and data integration are key components of this project. ToxCast is just one of our data sources.
